                <p> This Patented extract (NAE-8&circledR; and NAE-14&circledR;(NAE-8<sub>i</sub>)) is derived through a proprietary process resulting in the skin industries' most unique and revolutionary ingredient; Nerium oleander and Aloe extract. NAE-8&circledR; is our original domestic formulation of Nerium oleander and Aloe extract, while NAE-14&circledR;(NAE-8<sub>i</sub>) is our international formulation.
               Studies has shown the ability to produce immune activation in human cells especially those that are related to and important for the health and well-being of skin tissues.</p>

                    <li>The combination of NAE-14® added to WSEM also produced enhancement of the innate immune system. The combination also led to very large increases in such important chemokines as GRO-α, GRO-β and fractalkine.

                <p>This advanced technology process retains the natural ratios of key elements found in nature’s potent life source of proteins and peptides from water soluble egg membrane (WSEM) that are beneficial to skin. These peptides include collagen, elastin, desmosine, isodesmosine and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). BiovaDerm® is processed through an all natural OvaPure™ mechanical process. The ability of WSEM to stimulate specific genes associated with a transcription activation factor known Nrf-2 which, in turn, activates Antioxidant Response Elements (AREs; genes associated with antioxidant activity) was assessed as well as the ability of human primary dermal fibroblasts to produce matrix components collagen and elastin.</p>

                    <li>Treatment of facial skin in this clinical study resulted in a significant reduction in wrinkles around the eye (so-called “crow’s feet”).</li>
                    <li>WSEM triggered up-regulation of Antioxidant Response Elements (AREs) which are associated with enhanced antioxidant responses. Associated with this was a significant reduction in reactive oxygen species (free radicals).</li>
                    <li>Human dermal fibroblasts treated with WSEM in vitro showed a robust increase in the production of hyaluronan, collagen and elastin all of which are important elements associated with improved skin hydration and function and, in turn, are important for as reduction of facial wrinkles. In fact, WSEM increased hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) production by up to 25-fold which is critical for improved skin hydration.</li>
                    <li>The results suggest that the complex Peptide-Matrix in hydrolyzed egg membrane holds promise in support of skin health, especially in protection from free radical induced damage to skin tissue. The effects were seen on three different cell types that are interconnected in the process of age-related wrinkle formation: dermal fibroblasts, dermal keratinocytes and polymorphonuclear cells from the blood circulation. </li>

                <p>When basil and parsley are extracted and combined in the correct way it creates a unique synergy (called PB 8), which is extremely efficacious on the skin. This is what RexCure has discovered, allowing us to take advantage of the potency of the herbs in a completely new way. RexCure uses nothing but fresh, 100% organic herbs of high quality from Danish organic nurseries.</p>
