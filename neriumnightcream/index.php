             <p>  The following reports represent results of testing of Nerium Skincare products and their major components by an independent laboratory. Samples were sent to Mat-Tek, Inc. in a blinded fashion without the test facility knowing the identity of the samples supplied to them. The following is a summary of the test results. The test company uses a unique 3D model of human skin which is grown in tissue culture. Using the Mat-Tek system samples can be applied topically to human skin samples and changes monitored using both biochemical tests and histopathologic analyses using microscope examination of the tissue samples.</p>

<h4>Evaluation of Nerium Formulation (NeriumAD Night Cream) on Oxidant and Skin Aging Endpoints in the EpiDerm
model of human skin</h4><br/>
<h4>Study Number:  047-14a</h4><br/>
<p>This study evaluated the effects of NeriumAD Night Cream on key biomarkers of oxidation and skin-aging in a human skin model.  Accordingly, the study showed that NeriumAD Night Cream produced significant increases in gene s for expression of Metallothionein and Superoxide Dismutase proteins.  Both Metallothionein and Superoxide Dismutase are proteins that protect cells and tissues from oxidative injury.  Furthermore, experimental studies have suggested that Metallothionein may provide protection against toxicity from metals such as mercury, arsenic, etc.  The study showed that NeriumAD Night Cream increased the expression of the genes encoding these proteins by almost four fold.
