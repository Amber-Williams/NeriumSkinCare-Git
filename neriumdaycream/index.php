             <p>  The following reports represent results of testing of Nerium Skincare products and their major components by an independent laboratory. Samples were sent to Mat-Tek, Inc. in a blinded fashion without the test facility knowing the identity of the samples supplied to them. The following is a summary of the test results. The test company uses a unique 3D model of human skin which is grown in tissue culture. Using the Mat-Tek system samples can be applied topically to human skin samples and changes monitored using both biochemical tests and histopathologic analyses using microscope examination of the tissue samples.</p>

<h4>Evaluation of Nerium Formulation (NeriumAD Day Cream) on Oxidant and Skin Aging Endpoints in the EpiDerm FT in vitro Skin Model</h4><br/>
<h4>Study Number:  047-14b</h4><br/>
<p>This study evaluated the effects of NeriumAD Day Cream on certain biomarkers of oxidation and skin-aging in a human skin model.  Accordingly, the study showed that NeriumAD Day Cream significantly increased expression of the gene for Superoxide Dismutase by almost three fold.   Superoxide dismutase is a protein that protects the cells and tissues from oxidative injury, but more importantly from the highly reactive oxidant, superoxide (a free radical form of oxygen that can contribute to dermal injury).  Due to its well-recognized antioxidant activity, Superoxide Dismutase has been shown in other studies to have powerful anti-inflammatory activity.
