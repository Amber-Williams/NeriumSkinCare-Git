        <div class="panel-body"><p>As a commitment to quality, Nerium SkinCare does not compromise on what goes into our products. The quality of Nerium Skincare's products is a direct result of the investment into the people, scientific research, new technology development, natural farming methods, biomass processing, cGMP production facilities, and product safety testing.</p>

                      <p>The Nerium Farms™ is the largest Nerium oleander operation of its kind in the world. Using environmentally responsible and sustainable techniques, these naturally grown Nerium oleander plants, provide the raw material that make Nerium SkinCare’s products revolutionary. Abiding by strict protocols, the Nerium oleander farm provides a dedicated and renewable biomass resource that is reserved exclusively for Nerium SkinCare.</p>

                    <p>Considering that there were no historical accounts of <i>Nerium oleander</i> farming, it was imperative for Nerium SkinCare to develop our own farming operations in order to broaden and commercialize access to the plant. Initially, transitioning of the plant from the nursery environment into a commercial environment involved the establishment of a research entity that allowed scientists to understand the growth patterns properly. Over time, as the physiology of <i>Nerium oleander</i> became more evident, planting and irrigation techniques, along with harvesting and planting equipment, had to be newly developed. Nerium SkinCare is proud to say that we built our current farming operations from the ground up.</p>

                    <p>After a decade of experience in <i>Nerium oleander</i> commercial farming, Nerium SkinCare continues to focus on new technology and research that will allow us to enhance our farming operations. We are very proud of our all natural approach and adherence to strict biomedical field protocols. We continually seek ways to increase land utilization and field plant capacity through the development of improved planting and irrigations techniques. Plans for field expansion are also in place.</p>

                    <p>Nerium SkinCare is proud of our core competency to control the entire process from the seedling into the final finished product.</p></div>

                        We observed skin healing properties when researching the Nerium oleander plant in our labs. The history of Nerium SkinCare begins with groundbreaking research conducted by Dr. Robert Newman during his time with our parent company, Nerium Biotechnology. Dr. Newman’s research with natural botanical compounds led to the re-discovery, identification, isolation, and further development of core ingredients from the Nerium oleander plant. Continuing research and utilization of proprietary technologies has provided us the opportunity to develop a series of products that you know today as the NeriumAD® line of skin care.</p>

                        <p>Historical use of the Nerium oleander plant has been reported in ancient texts and folklore for more than 1,500 years. In fact, the Nerium oleander plant has been used traditionally as folk remedies for a wide variety of conditions. Over the last decade, there has been a considerable increase in the number of peer-reviewed studies in science journals that substantiate the properties of the Nerium oleander plant and its benefits.</p></div>

                            <p>The Nerium Farms™ is the largest Nerium oleander operation of its kind in the world. With over 100,000 Nerium oleander plants, we employ natural and organic farming practices and our orchard helps to minimize our carbon footprint by eliminating greenhouse gases throughout the year.</p>

                <p>Our science begins at the farm where we use the latest horticulture techniques for watering, farming, and harvesting. For example, by also incorporating the use of the latest analytical instruments, we are better able to determine the optimal time for harvesting. Similar analytic processes are employed in other aspects of farming. From beginning to end, from farm to manufacturer to consumers, Nerium SkinCare is dedicated to providing real science and real results.</p>

                <p>“We’re primarily after the leaves. And that's the reason why we do not want any irrigation water; we do not want any type of chemicals; nothing on the leaves. So it is a very specialized approach, it's extremely laborious, and it's very very expensive. No one has attempted to put in an orchard like this and they still haven’t. It's not that easy to get involved in this industry. It's very complex; there’s a lot of science that goes into it. Science not only starting at the field itself but all the way through the processing as well as to the end use. So it's an extremely complex dynamic approach. There’s no question in my mind that this field is much more than a field of dreams. It truly is a field of life”– Joel Curtis, Chief Agricultural Officer of Nerium Farms™</p>
