             <p>  The following reports represent results of testing of Nerium Skincare products and their major components by an independent laboratory. Samples were sent to Mat-Tek, Inc. in a blinded fashion without the test facility knowing the identity of the samples supplied to them. The following is a summary of the test results. The test company uses a unique 3D model of human skin which is grown in tissue culture. Using the Mat-Tek system samples can be applied topically to human skin samples and changes monitored using both biochemical tests and histopathologic analyses using microscope examination of the tissue samples.</p>

<p>Nerium SkinCare does not use animal testing for any of its efficacy or safety tests.</p>

<h4>EEvaluation of  Nerium Formulation (NeriumAD CS Cream) on Oxidant and Skin Aging Endpoints in the EpiDerm FT in vitro Skin Model</h4><br/>
<h4>Study Number:  047-14c</h4><br/>
<p>This study evaluated the effects of NeriumCS Cream on the biomarkers of oxidation and skin-aging in a human skin model.  Accordingly, the study showed that NeriumCS Cream significantly
increased expression of genes for both Metallothionein 2A and Superoxide Dismutase.  Both Metallothionein and Superoxide dismutase are proteins that protect cells and tissues from oxidative injury.  Furthermore, experimental studies have suggested that Metallothionein may provide protection against toxicity from metals such as mercury, arsenic, etc.  The study showed that NeriumCS Cream increased the expression of the genes encoding these proteins by almost five fold.
