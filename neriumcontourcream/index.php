             <p>  The following reports represent results of testing of Nerium Skincare products and their major components by an independent laboratory. Samples were sent to Mat-Tek, Inc. in a blinded fashion without the test facility knowing the identity of the samples supplied to them. The following is a summary of the test results. The test company uses a unique 3D model of human skin which is grown in tissue culture. Using the Mat-Tek system samples can be applied topically to human skin samples and changes monitored using both biochemical tests and histopathologic analyses using microscope examination of the tissue samples.</p>

<p>Nerium SkinCare does not use animal testing for any of its efficacy or safety tests.</p>

<h4>Evaluation of a Nerium Formulation (NeriumFirm) on Oxidant and Skin Aging Endpoints in the EpiDerm FT in vitro Skin Model</h4><br/>
<h4>Study Number:  047-14e</h4><br/>
<p>This study evaluated the effects of NeriumFirm on biomarkers of oxidation and skin-aging in a human skin model.  Accordingly, the study showed that NeriumFirm significantly increased expression of the gene for Metallothionein - 2A.  Metallothionein s are antioxidative proteins with the capacity to bind a wide array of heavy metals. The study showed that NeriumFirm increased the expression of genes encoding Metallothonein2A by at least two fold.</p>
