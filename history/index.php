            <p>We observed skin healing properties when researching the Nerium oleander plant in our labs. The history of Nerium SkinCare begins with groundbreaking research conducted by Dr. Robert Newman during his time with our parent company, Nerium Biotechnology. Dr. Newmanâ€™s research with natural botanical compounds led to the re-discovery, identification, isolation, and further development of core ingredients from the <i>Nerium oleander</i> plant. Continuing research and utilization of proprietary technologies has provided us the opportunity to develop a series of products that you know today as the NeriumAD<sup><span class="rSymbol">&circledR;</span></sup> line of skin care.</p>

            <p>Historical use of the <i>Nerium oleander</i> plant has been reported in ancient texts and folklore for more than 1,500 years. In fact, the <i>Nerium oleander</i> plant has been used traditionally as folk remedies for a wide variety of conditions. Over the last decade, there has been a considerable increase in the number of peer-reviewed studies in science journals that substantiate the properties of the <i>Nerium oleander</i> plant and its benefits.</p>
